# KourHero — Progress Log

Kour.io-inspired low-poly browser arena FPS. Single-file `index.html` + vendored Three.js r160
(`lib/three.module.js`, offline-capable PWA). Built on the process in `C:\Users\adamt\GAME_DEV_PLAYBOOK.md`.

**Plan:** Phase 1 = polished single-player FFA deathmatch vs AI bots. Phase 2 = local Node
WebSocket multiplayer (authoritative server, bots fill lobbies).

## How to run / verify
- Play: serve the folder (`npx serve` or any static server), open in browser. Needs pointer lock.
- Static verify: `node tools/verify.mjs` (syntax, brace balance, el() ids, sw version).
- Headless playtest: `node tools/playtest.js` (boots game in Edge+SwiftShader, simulates play,
  screenshots into `tools/shots/`, asserts no console errors). `npm i` inside `tools/` first.
- Every release: bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` (currently v001) + commit.

## Backlog (roughly ordered)
- [ ] ADS/scope for touch devices (currently desktop RMB only)
- [ ] Progression: XP/levels, cosmetic skins for bots+viewmodel (playbook §5)
- [ ] Phase 2b: MP combat — server-authoritative fire/hit/hp/kills, killfeed + scoreboard from server
- [ ] Phase 2c: server-side bots to fill MP lobbies; match timer + rounds on server
- [ ] MP polish: interpolation buffer (currently rate-lerp), remote anim (walk bob), join/leave sounds

## Releases (newest first)
- **v006** (2026-07-02 ~04:20): Phase 2a — multiplayer foundation. Map extracted to
  `shared/map.mjs` (boxes/spawns/pads/pickups/phys consts; client builds meshes from it, solo
  playtest confirmed identical). `server/server.mjs`: static hosting + ws (same port), join/leave
  with roster, 20Hz snapshots, movement validation (speed cap sprint*1.6+slack, arena bounds,
  finite checks). Client: MULTIPLAYER button (connect to location.host, 3s fail hint), remote
  avatars = bot mesh + canvas-sprite name tags, target-lerp interpolation with angle-wrap fix,
  join/leave killfeed lines, 20Hz input send, ONLINE HUD mode, no local bots/match-end in MP.
  Key fix: pointer-lock loss in MP no longer exits to menu (was disconnecting players on
  alt-tab/focus loss — canvas click re-locks, 2nd Esc leaves). tools/mptest.js: spawns server +
  2 headless clients; Alice's 7.2u move seen by Bob with 0.0 gap; remote removed on leave; 0
  errors. NOTE for tests: background tabs pause rAF — assert on r.target, not mesh position.
  Playtest MIME map needed .mjs. SW → v006 (caches shared/map.mjs).
- **v005** (2026-07-02 ~04:09): 5-weapon roster + ADS + streaks + death cam. New SMG (13dmg/
  900rpm/35mag) and Sniper (90dmg = 2-body/1-head, 5mag, huge hip spread 0.045, adsSpread 0.001).
  Right-mouse ADS: sniper → FOV 26 + full scope overlay (crosshair+viewmodel hidden, slower look
  scaled by fov/75), other weapons → FOV 55 steady-aim with 0.4x spread. Kill streak callouts
  (DOUBLE/TRIPLE/QUAD/RAMPAGE/UNSTOPPABLE + HEADSHOT) with rising jingle; streak resets on death.
  Death cam: camera sinks + rolls 0.45rad, "Respawning in N…" countdown. Weapon keys 1–5.
  Gotcha: ADS block needed its own WEAPONS lookup (`wpn`) — `const w` later in updatePlayer = TDZ.
  Headless: ADS fov 26/75 + scope show/hide + death/respawn cycle asserted, 0 errors. SW → v005.
- **v004** (2026-07-02 ~04:03): Mobile touch controls + match settings. Touch: floating left
  stick (move; >0.92 deflection = sprint), right-zone look drag, FIRE/JUMP/swap/reload/pause
  buttons, touch-specific HUD layout (`body.touch` CSS, not width media query — 900px landscape
  phones missed the breakpoint). Pointer lock skipped on touch. Menu settings with localStorage
  persistence (`kh_set`): bots 3/5/7, difficulty Easy/Normal/Hard (bot skill base 0.4/0.6/0.78 +
  damage x0.7/1.0/1.3), match length 3/5/10min. Emulated-touch headless test: fire tap −1 ammo,
  look drag Δyaw 1.0rad, stick drag moved 9.5u, settings applied (3 bots, skills .46–.56, 3:00),
  0 errors. SW cache → v004.
- **v003** (2026-07-02 ~03:57): Weapon feel + pickups + jump pads. Distinct low-poly viewmodels
  per weapon (rifle barrel/receiver/mag/stock, shotgun pump, pistol slide), muzzle-flash sprite
  at barrel tip (45ms) + camera recoil kick per weapon (springs back at 9/s). Pickups: 3 health
  (+40) incl. one on the tower top, 2 ammo (+1 mag each weapon, cap 2x reserve), spin/bob,
  15s respawn, bots grab health when <65hp. Kour-style jump pads: 2 launch to tower top (v=19),
  2 corner pads (v=15); work for bots too; pulse+boing on use. JUMP_V 8.5→9.0 and small crates
  1.8→1.5 so crates are jumpable steps. Functional headless tests: pad apex 6.3 (tower=6 ✓),
  hp 30→70 ✓, reserve 10→40 ✓, 0 errors. SW cache → v003.
- **v002** (2026-07-02 ~03:50): True FFA — bots now acquire the nearest visible enemy (player OR
  other bots) via `acquireEnemy()`, fight/strafe/shoot whoever it is; kill credit + kill feed for
  bot-vs-bot. Generalized `botShoot(b, enemy)` and `damageBot(..., attacker)`; gunshot volume now
  scales with distance to the *player* (listener), not the target. Obstacle steering: 2.2u feeler
  raycast ahead, slide toward the clearer of ±57° when blocked. Mid-edge spawns shifted sideways
  so they no longer stare into the cover bars. Enemy switch resets the reaction window. Soak
  test (45s headless): 7 bot-vs-bot kills, 0 stuck bots, 0 errors. SW cache → v002.
- **v001** (2026-07-02 ~03:45): Initial playable build. Three.js r160 vendored. Pointer-lock FPS
  (WASD/jump/sprint, accel-based movement, AABB collision vs box colliders). 3 hitscan weapons
  (Rifle auto 600rpm/22dmg, Shotgun 7-pellet, Pistol 30dmg) with mag/reserve/reload, spread,
  2x headshots (ray-sphere head/body). 5 AI bots: waypoint roam, LOS raycast, combat strafe,
  reaction delay 0.35–0.8s before firing, hit chance falls with distance (pHit ≤0.6), hop while
  fighting, respawn 2.5s at furthest spawn. Arena 90x90: perimeter walls, center tower, mirrored
  crates/blocks, decorative trees outside. HUD: health bar, ammo, weapon name, crosshair,
  hitmarker, damage vignette, kill feed (5 max), score pill + match timer (5min / 25-kill target),
  hold-Tab scoreboard, menu/game-over overlays. Procedural WebAudio SFX (shoot/hit/kill/hurt/
  reload/jump/die). PWA: manifest + SVG icon + sw.js (network-first navigations, playbook §4),
  SW only registers on github.io/localhost. Bugs fixed during build: spawn yaw was 180° inverted
  (atan2(-x,-z) → atan2(x,z) — flat-green-screen symptom); viewmodel near-end sat at camera plane
  (looked giant); bots too lethal (7 bots, no reaction delay → dead in <5s standing still; now
  5 bots + reaction window + pHit cap 0.6 → HP ~73 after 5s exposed).
